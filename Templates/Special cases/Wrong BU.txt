Hello , 

[a] I’d like to thank you for your time on Friday's Teams meeting, it was a pleasure speaking with you. 
    Please be advised that after our call, I immediately began investigating internally for resolutions for your enquiry.
[b] After our last email discussion I began investigating your issue internally, in efforts to find a proper resolution for your enquiry.

Allow me to first begin by clarifying that RSA has been divided into multiple Business units for the different products delivered by RSA. And as such, new support portals and/or community websites launched for supporting RSA®, NetWitness®, Archer® and Outseer® respectively.

After conducting my investigation internally, I was able to confirm that your enquiry requires assistance from the [Outseer|Archer|Netwitness] support team, not the RSA team in which I operate.

As such, please be advised that no further relief can be provided via this ticket, a new one will be required to be opened via [Outseer|Archer|Netwitness]'s wesbite: https://outseer.force.com/outseervision/s/  
   
And henceforth, please be advised that for any technical/administrative/sales requests, please make sure to contact your concerned product support Team to assist you further by checking out this [Outseer|Archer|Netwitness] Customer Support Guide https://outseer.force.com/outseervision/s/how-to-contact-support

Let me know if this answers your questions, and if you have any further enquiries please feel free to reply to this email.

Best Regards,
Nadeem Naoum | Technical Support Engineer | SecurID - RSA Security.
