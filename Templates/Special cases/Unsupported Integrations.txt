Hello 

I hope you are doing well.

1. 	
	A) Please note that <Vendor Product> is currently not within the list of supported vendor integrations. <Vendor Product> had not been formally implemented and tested by our engineering team in charge of product development and therefore, we can not warrant that this integration method will work. As such, we do not support this integration type.
	
	B) As of now, there is no direct, supported method of integrating RSA SecurID products with <Vendor Product>. This does not guarantee that the integration will fail. However, it hasn't been tested and verified by our product engineers, and therefore, we can not provide further support should the implementation now work.
	
	C) Searching for RSA's Supported vendor integrations through the below link, I have not been able to find an integration guide for <Vendor Product>.
	
	D) Kindly be advised that the "<Vendor Product>" third-party product mentioned in the case description is not among the listed products supported by RSA. Henceforth, please note that we can not offer further support for this integration.
