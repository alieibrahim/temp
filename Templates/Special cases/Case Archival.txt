It was a great pleasure to support you.

I will proceed to archive the case as per discussed, you may proceed to unarchive the case once you are ready to continue by calling our customer support line (Numbers provided in my signature below) and request the unarchiving of this ticker (#{case.casenumber}), at which point it will be opened again for continued support

Also, You might receive a link to a survey shortly, I would appreciate it if you can spare few minutes to fill it specially ((Thinking of your recent Service event, how satisfied are you with the service you received from RSA?)) as it directly affects my performance.

Have your say with a Customer Satisfaction Survey as your feedback is important for us to improve and deliver better support for you.
