Hello 

I hope you are doing well.

I have taken ownership of your support case.

	A) However and due to economic sanctions, SecurID, an RSA Company, cannot engage currently with any customers in Russia or Belarus. Therefore, we must close your Support case, or decline your request for a new Support request.

	B) Please note that due to the current economic dissensions, SecurID, an RSA Company, will not be able to engage with customers in Russia or Belarus. As a result, we will proceed to close your Support case or decline further support requests for the time being.

Thanks for your understanding.
