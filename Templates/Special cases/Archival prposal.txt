Greetings ,

Kindly be advised that I cannot keep a ticket open for more than three business days without any technical updates.

We can proceed to archive the case, and you may call our customer support line should you have any further need for assistance regarding the issue at a future note, and they will proceed to unarchive the case for you for continued support.

Let me know if this answers your questions, and if you have any further enquiries please feel free to reply to this email.

Best regards,
Nadeem Naoum | Technical Support Engineer | SecurID - RSA Security.
